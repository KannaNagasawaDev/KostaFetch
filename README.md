<h1>KostaFetch</h1>
The ultimate zero-dependency system information tool. Born at 3:00 AM in a dark room filled with 'No such file or directory' errors. It doesn't need fastfetch, it doesn't need screenfetch, it only needs your soul and a working /sys directory. Built by Arch users who find 'installing a 500kb package' too bloat.
